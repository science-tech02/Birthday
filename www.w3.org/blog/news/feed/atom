					<content type="html" xml:base="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9349"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/aria">Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group</a> has published a First Public Working Draft of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-dpub-aam-1.1-20211130/">Digital Publishing Accessibility API Mappings 1.1</a>. The Digital Publishing Accessibility API Mappings (DPub-AAM) defines how <a class="termref informative">user agents</a> map the Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module [<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-dpub-aam-1.1-20211130/#bib-dpub-aria-1.1">dpub-aria-1.1</a>] markup to platform <a class="termref informative"> accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a>. It is intended for user agent developers responsible for accessibility in their user agent so that they can support the accessibility content produced for digital publishing.</p>
<p>The implementation of this specification in user agents enables authors to produce more accessible e-books, by conveying structural book constructs used by the digital publishing industry to assistive technologies. It does this by extending the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam-1.1/">Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/">Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1</a> specifications for user agents. It provides Accessibility API Mapping guidance for the roles defined in the Digital Publish WAI-ARIA Module.</p>
<p>The DPub-AAM is part of the WAI-ARIA suite described in the<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/"> WAI-ARIA Overview</a>.</p>

This vocabulary, a part of EPUB 3, defines a set of properties relating to the description of structural semantics of written works.</p>
<p>Structural semantics add additional meaning about the specific structural purpose an HTML (or SVG) element plays. The <code>epub:type</code> attribute, defined in EPUB 3.3, is used to express domain-specific semantics in EPUB Content Documents and Media Overlay Documents, with the structural information it carries complementing the underlying vocabulary. The applied semantics refine the meaning of their containing elements without changing their nature for assistive technologies, as happens when using the similar <code>role</code> attribute in HTML. The attribute does not enhance the accessibility of the content, in other words, only provides hints about the purpose. This documents defines the default vocabulary that can be used with the <code>epub:type</code> attribute.</p>
