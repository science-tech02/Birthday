					<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris, thanks for your kind words regarding my talk.

I unfortunately think that we have a presumption in the English speaking world that English dominates. As I mentioned in my talk, there are actual laws where I live prohibiting teachers to teach in Spanish or even bilingually. To think, the teaching of communication and language - a crime! 

As with so many things, it&#039;s awareness that can help. It becomes so obvious that the Web is more useful, accessible and downright interesting when it is filled with the many cultures and languages expressed worldwide.

I hope to do many more presentations of this nature and encourage everyone to look around the site here. Richard and the i18n Working Group have put together some amazing resources here, some of the quiet best at the W3C. I&#039;m hoping to not keep that so quiet in the future ;-)

					<description><![CDATA[Such a good talk at the @Media Conference. Molly was very passionate about this subject and the aduience got some really useful advice about addressing the &#039;world&#039; in the &#039;world wide web&#039;.

There is also an educational issue - our are schools creating enough linguists who might combine their enthusiasm for web techniologies to create multicultural sites? Or are we presuming that the dominant language of the web is English forever?

					<description><![CDATA[Gerard, Please look at our recently published article Understanding the New Language Tags, which talks about RFC3066bis, and how that will incorporate ISO 639-3 codes when they are finalised.  This should take care of the zh problem you mentioned.  Note that you can already use zh-Hant and zh-Hans for Traditional and Simplified Chinese.

					<description><![CDATA[One of the basis elements of the ITS is that it assumes other standards. Of particular relevance to me is the RFC3066bis that is referred to for language identification.

There are two things wrong with this standard; it lacks information on many languages; ISO-639-3 which is sadly still a dis will help out. However this raises issues; zh is Chinese but it is no longer considered one language. There will also be many new languages that do not have any older codes.

When this code is meant for identifying resources, any resources, than it is important to be able to identify the specific version of an orthography. This needs to be done in a standard way and there is no standard for this.

Consequently; it must be possible to indicate at least ISO-639-3 without any reference to the older codes. There must be a standard way to indicate a version of an orthography.

Without this this schema will work for some but will be sadly deficient for others.

					<description><![CDATA[Subject: Re: First Letter Styling for Indian languages


Hi All,
For Devanagari script, Bengali and Assamese scripts etc, we often use first letter styling ( with or with little extended headstrokes or without headstrokes ). Content Editor uses increased font size / style face for the so called &quot;a drop letter.&quot;  Question of aligning headstrokes does not arise here. Bengali example:



Regards,
Goutam
