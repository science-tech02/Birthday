        <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> is a growing and global community where <a href="#dfn-participant" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">participants</a> choose
        to work together. <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> is committed to maintaining a positive working
        environment, where each participant feels appreciated and respected and
        where everyone adheres to the same high level of standards of personal
        behavior. In that process we experience differences in language,
        location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment,
        misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be
        resolved informally.

        <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>'s <cite>Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</cite>

        promote high standards of professional practice. The goal of this code

        participate without fear of <a href="#dfn-harass" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">harassment</a>. It also provides a

        of the organization.

        The <abbr title="Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct">CEPC</abbr> is complemented by a set of <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures">Procedures</a>, applies

        Statement of Intent
      <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#statement-of-intent"></a></h2>
      <p>
        <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> is committed to maintaining a <strong>positive</strong> work
        environment. This commitment calls for a workplace where
        <a href="#dfn-participant" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">participants</a> at all levels behave according to the rules of the
        following code. A foundational concept of this code is that <em>we all
        share responsibility</em> for our work environment.
      </p>

          Expected Behavior
        <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#expected-behavior"></a></h3>

        <p>
          Treat each other with respect,
          professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences
          and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Appreciate and accommodate our similarities and differences. We
          come from many cultures and backgrounds, ways of life, and standards
          of behavior. Cultural differences can encompass everything from
          official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be
          respectful of people with different practices, attitudes, and
          beliefs. To help us achieve and maintain these high standards, each
          individual participant is expected to share responsibility for our
          work environment by adhering to the behavioral guidelines herein.
          </li>
          <li>Have empathy when discussing sensitive issues. Some participants
          may have experienced (or been subjected to) various forms of violence
          in their lives, which may cause distress when they are reminded of
          it. Avoid making jokes or callously mentioning sexual violence such
          as stalking or sexual assault; in cases when the need arises to
          discuss these issues and how they affect people - do so with tact and
          empathy taking into account the gravity of the situation, and make
          sure that <a href="#dfn-participant" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">participants</a> are appropriately warned in advance so
          they can choose to step out of these discussions.
          </li>
          <li>Treat everyone with respect. We are a large community of people who are passionate
          about our work, sometimes holding strong opinions and beliefs. We are
          committed to dealing with each other with courtesy, respect, and
          dignity at all times. Misunderstandings and disagreements do happen.
          When conflicts arise, we are expected to resolve them maintaining
          that courtesy, respect, and dignity, even when emotions are
          heightened.
          </li>
          <li>Do not accept or engage in abusive behavior in any form, whether it is
        verbal, physical, sexual, or implied.</li>
          <li>Be honest. Be truthful, sincere, forthright and, unless professional duties require confidentiality or special discretion, candid, straightforward, and frank.</li>
          <li>Be inclusive and promote <a href="#dfn-diversity" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">diversity</a>. Seek diverse
          perspectives. Diversity of views and of people powers innovation,
          even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new
          perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself
          dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and
          encourage other voices to join in. Provide alternative ways to
          contribute.
          </li>
          <li>Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the
          group.
          </li>
          <li>Be aware that displays of affection may complicate professional
          relationships. For some cultures, overtly friendly disposition
          towards another participant involving body contact (e.g.: hugging,
          touching on the arm or shoulder, or kissing) is uncommon and may be
          perceived as an invasion of personal space, or as unwelcome advances.
          </li>
          <li>Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices, and discriminatory
          practices.
          </li>
          <li>Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred
          names, titles (including pronouns), and the appropriate tone of
          voice. Therefore, be formal and conservative in what you do and
          liberal in what you accept from others and acknowledge the
          contributions of your peers.
          </li>
		<li>Accommodate participants' needs for physical distancing and other accommodations or precautions due to health concerns such as immune deficiency, allergies, or chemical sensitivity.</li>
          <li>Be sensitive to language differences. English is the default

          struggle to understand fast and/or quiet speech and may speak louder
          than they usually would when communicating in their native tongue. If

                  example, beginning an interjection with "Well, actually..."

        In most instances if you have an issue with someone’s behavior along

        In most cases, issues are best resolved at the source. Accordingly,

        and team contacts also have more of the context which helps them
        address the issue.

      <p>
        As we engage in diverse communities we may accidentally cause offense,

        missing social cues.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you realize (or are told) that you have offended someone then take
        the appropriate steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Acknowledge that you've done something improper
        </li>
        <li>Briefly apologize. Don't try to explain yourself or minimize the

        <li>If possible, edit your message, restate your communication in a
        better way or withdraw your statement. Publicly revising your statement
        helps define the culture for others
